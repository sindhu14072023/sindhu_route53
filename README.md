Global Load Balancing with Amazon Route 53
■ Utilize Amazon Route 53 for DNS management and global load balancing.
■ Implement health checks to route traffic to healthy endpoints.
■ Leverage geolocation-based routing and latency-based routing for optimized user experience.
■ Integrate with AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and alerting.

•	Set up your domain in Amazon Route 53.
•	Create the necessary DNS records to point your domain to your AWS resources.
•	Choose the appropriate load balancing method based on your requirements.
•	Create a latency-based routing policy in Route 53 and to Define the regions or endpoints you want to route traffic to base on latency.
'Create a geolocation-based routing policy in Route 53 and Define rules based on geographic locations and direct traffic accordingly.
•	Implement health checks to ensure that Route 53 only directs traffic to healthy endpoints.
•	Configure health checks for each endpoint to monitor its status and Adjust the routing policies to route traffic away from unhealthy endpoints.
•	Set up CloudWatch alarms to monitor the health of your resources and Define thresholds for metrics like latency, error rates, and other relevant metrics.
•	Create CloudWatch Alarms to trigger notifications or automated actions when thresholds are breached.
•	Continuously monitor and analyze the performance of your application and infrastructure using CloudWatch metrics.
